A playground for Swift

The idea is that you select the road sections of interest for your daily commute and have live traffic data right in your Notification Center with the new iOS 8 widget. Each road section will be color coded to give a fast overview.

TODO
----

  * Let the user define a collection(s) of road sections of interest.
  * Let the user activate a collection to get it in the Notification Center as a widget.
  * Create Notification Center Widget
  * Do more fun stuff
